                    <p>As a child, I spent many an hour tapping spaghetti code in BASIC into my Commodore 64. One of my
                       great achievements then was creating a Pacman game with graphics composed of ASCII characters.
                       Wind forward 15 years and I discovered that computing could be fun as well as useful. I studied
                       mechanical engineering at Imperial College London and then continued on to post-graduate
                       studies.</p>
                    <p>My PhD was all about vortices. I built an experimental rig to enable me to study vortex systems
                       in a water tank. The rig was <span class="font-italic">proper</span> mechanical engineering.
                       Motors. Gears. Pulleys. Bearings. A custom-designed large tank of water. At the time, my
                       supervisor made a few sarcastic remarks about my Victorian-style over-engineering of the tank but
                       that was preferable to it failing and dumping 3 tonnes of water across the lab floor, turning the
                       place into a swimming pool. I would certainly never have heard the end of that.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the traditional engineering side of my PhD, I wrote some code. I wrote a LabView
                       program to finely control the motor which in turn controlled the vortex characteristics. That
                       was useful. The other thing was that the experiment generated a load of data. And this is where I
                       truly discovered the power of coding and gained a passion for it. Coding enabled me to process
                       large quantities of experimental data in a reasonable amount of time and in an auditable and
                       reproducible fashion.</p>

                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>After 8 years at university, I decided that I was ready to apply what I had learned to an
                       industrial setting. I took a role in a young and growing R&D centre at Doosan Babcock, a South
                       Korean owned engineering company in the energy sector.</p>
                    <p>When I joined, a substantial project was in progress to give a widely-used and respected in-house
                       software tool a facelift. The tool, originally developed in the 1970s with input via punch card,
                       was used by engineers to design utility boilers for power plants. The facelift involved updating
                       the program with all the mod cons: readable code, automated testing, decent documentation, a
                       graphical user interface... I was recruited as a kind of interface between the engineering folk
                       and the software developers.</p>
                    <p>My main role was to oversee the software specification and testing program and ultimately, to
                       ensure that the chief engineer would sign off each software release. I guess my role was akin to
                       the 'product owner' using agile software development terminology. I had to maintain the peace
                       between the engineers who had been using the legacy tool for several decades, and the software
                       development team who were replacing it. This was often challenging - the secret to success was
                       listening and an ability to empathise. The engineers had the utmost respect for the legacy
                       tool: one of the key requirements for winning trust was to demonstrate beyond doubt that the
                       facelifted software produced identical results to the original legacy tool.</p>

                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>After completing this work, I experienced what I consider to be one of the most enlightening
                       moments of my research career. My line manager set me a challenge. All of the automated testing
                       was great. A big step forward in terms of quality assurance. It gave the engineers confidence
                       that the new software was doing the sums set out in the holy grail (aka the Technical Manual)
                       correctly and this went a long way to maintaining the peace. But. A big but. Only a few people
                       were asking: are the equations set out in the holy grail right? Or more to the point, what
                       'right' really meant.</p>
                    <p>The equations were from empirical models - a respected part of the companyâ€™s heritage and
                       knowledge. However, they were models and in the words often attributed to George Box: "All models
                       are wrong, but some are useful". Challenged with the question of showing that the empirical
                       models were 'right' lead me to understand that the way to answer this required the application of
                       statistics. Admittedly until that time, I was rather dismissive of the value of statistics,
                       mostly because I did not actually know as much about them as I should have. For whatever reason,
                       until this time, the real purpose of statistics just had not 'clicked' with me. In my quest for
                       enlightenment, I discovered several MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses) on statistics, delved
                       right in and found myself fascinated by the role statistics plays in extracting meaningful
                       knowledge from data.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>From this point on, I was hooked on data science. I discovered the R programming language which,
                       although at first I found to be a slightly awkward language, I grew to admire greatly. In
                       particular, I really enjoy working with the RStudio products for example the
                        <samp>tidyverse</samp> and <samp>shiny</samp>. I think they make for beautiful code and output.
                       I really enjoy working in Python too and more recently have been using it for data work. In fact,
                       I have written this website with Python using <samp>flask</samp>.</p>
                    <p>This journey lead to me becoming one of the company's data 'go to' people. I was not alone: a few
                       like-minded and qualified folk had teamed up i.e. STEM PhD people who liked coding, data and
                       geeky conversations. Our mission: to put the company's data to good use and put the company's
                       digital innovation ambitions into practice. We learned a lot along the way and from each
                       other.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite projects involved using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to automatically
                       classify images of welding defects by defect type. The norm was that several thousand such images
                       were collected during site inspections and an expert would sift through and manually perform this
                       task. My neural network was not amazingly sophisticated and there was absolutely room for
                       improvement. But computer vision has a bit of 'wow' factor and the benefit of this application
                       was so blindingly obvious that even the most pessimistic of engineers could see it. I remember
                       demonstrating it to my colleague - he simply said: "That's epic". Yes. Yes, I thought. It isn't
                       bad. With a bit more work, it can be epic. </p>
                    <p>I love learning and I love the fact that I will never know everything. The world of coding and
                       data science, certainly in R and Python, is a great place for people like me, since the learning
                       resources are seemingly endless. The communities are creative, vibrant, diverse, amazingly
                       supportive and open. Its full of folk with my mindset: people who love to share their knowledge
                       and experience.</p>

                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>As much as I like to code, I do other stuff too. I have done some form of voluntary work since my
                       days in university. Voluntary work is something that I believe that I have a duty to do; to make
                       a contribution to society and the community, that is not motivated by financial benefit.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I volunteer as an IMB member. In summary, I sit on a monitoring board and our role is
                       to ensure that people subject to immigration detention are treated fairly and humanely. We make
                       unannounced visits to the detention centre regularly to perform our monitoring duties; we have
                       unfettered access to the centre and documents within. Our board report our monitoring activities
                       to the agencies responsible for running the centre and we report annually to the UK government's
                       Minister for Immigration. Due to the nature of the work, it is hardly 'enjoyable'. However, it is
                       often rewarding, in particular, when it is possible to bring about change. The work is sometimes
                       seemingly thankless; however, from time to time, appreciation is expressed and that's
                       rewarding.</p>
                    <p>Other than coding and volunteering, I like to spend my time walking, travelling and making the
                       most of nature. I am a guitarist and I cook a lot. Sometimes at the same time.</p>
