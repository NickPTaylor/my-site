# nickptaylor-website

This repo is for my personal website: www.nickptaylor.net.  The website is developed Python using [flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/).  I 'freeze' the website to a *static* website using [Frozen-Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Frozen-Flask/) and then I use an S3 bucket on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the site.  I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make the site look beautiful.
